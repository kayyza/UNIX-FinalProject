# Unix Final Project:
## <br><br>Project Description:
This project serves to host a static website that will display user's  portfolios online using a GNU/Linux web server. This will be implemented with the combination of manual deployment from our developers and auto-deployment so that the website keeps up to date with the github repository. <br><br>
To do so, the project requires the seting up of a VPS, and the set up a domain name for the website. <br><br>
This will allow our team members to handle basic system setup and security.<br><br>
For example, 
- giving permissions to the various user types that will access the website.

- Users types will include the following classifications: visitors with read-only permissions, normal users with read-and-write permissions and Admins who have all permissions granted. 

- Normal users and Admins will be required to create an account and authenticate it.
