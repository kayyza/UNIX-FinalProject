Worked on Project Team Proposal – Approximate Hours Spent: 3 hours 

- Researched possible VPS services we could use 
- Looked over class notes to see what recommendations for possible VPS services we use 
    - Asked ChatGPT for its recommendation based on the concept of the project 
        -	Asked about cheapest option 
        -	Asked about easiest option 
        -	Asked to compare to other options to see the di	erence between the choices 
        
    - Searched Google to see what recommendations and options were available 
        -	Compared the answer from ChatGPT to the “Google AI Overview”  Visited a couple of websites discussing options

I decided about the best choice after consulting all these resources and discussing with my teammates about their opinions. After the discussion and research, we’d decided on Digital Ocean being the best option for us.  
- Made a basic guideline for the requirements o Looked over class notes on this topic to get a general idea of the steps needed to take for our concept 
    - Asked ChatGPT for a guideline based on our requirements 
        -	Asked about basic system setup and security 
        -	Process/service management 
        -	Automated tasks o Searched Google similarly to how I did in the previous step (Comparing with 
ChatGPT and various websites)

I did not go into a lot of detail about the requirements, more so just a skeleton of what needs to be done. After reviewing the guidelines with teacher, I realized that more options and details should have been considered in the requirements for the Project Proposal. I also realized that the timeline at the end of the document needs to be fixed. I also came to realize that we need to make an INSTALL file and README file.
